Hello {{ recipient }}!

crates.io user {{ auth_user.gh_login }} removed a "Trusted Publishing" configuration for GitHub Actions from a crate that you manage ("{{ krate.name }}").

Trusted Publishing configuration:

- Repository owner: {{ config.repository_owner }}
- Repository name: {{ config.repository_name }}
- Workflow filename: {{ config.workflow_filename }}
- Environment: {{ config.environment or "(not set)" }}

If you did not make this change and you think it was made maliciously, you can email help@crates.io for assistance.
