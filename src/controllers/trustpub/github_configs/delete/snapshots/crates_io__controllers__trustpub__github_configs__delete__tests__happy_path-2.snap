Hello foo!

You removed a "Trusted Publishing" configuration for GitHub Actions from your crate "foo".

Trusted Publishing configuration:

- Repository owner: rust-lang
- Repository name: foo-rs
- Workflow filename: publish.yml
- Environment: (not set)

If you did not make this change and you think it was made maliciously, you can email help@crates.io for assistance.
