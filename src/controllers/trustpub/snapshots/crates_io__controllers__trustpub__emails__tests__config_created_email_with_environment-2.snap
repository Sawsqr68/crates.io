Hello octocat!

You added a new "Trusted Publishing" configuration for GitHub Actions to your crate "my-crate". Trusted publishers act as trusted users and can publish new versions of the crate automatically.

Trusted Publishing configuration:

- Repository owner: rust-lang
- Repository name: rust
- Workflow filename: publish.yml
- Environment: production

If you did not make this change and you think it was made maliciously, you can remove the configuration from the crate via the "Settings" tab on the crate's page.

If you are unable to revert the change and need to do so, you can email help@crates.io for assistance.
